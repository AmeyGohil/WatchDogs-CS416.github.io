                                <i>Rooting</i> (i.e., modifying the OS so that you can run commands as the root user) is recommended for testing on a real device. This gives you full control over the operating system and allows you to bypass restrictions such as app sandboxing. These privileges in turn allow you to use techniques like code injection and function hooking more easily.
                            </p>
                            Note that rooting is risky, and three main consequences need to be clarified before you proceed. Rooting can have the following negative effects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    voiding the device warranty (always check the manufacturer's policy before taking any action)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    "bricking" the device, i.e., rendering it inoperable and unusable
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    creating additional security risks (because built-in exploit mitigations are often removed)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                You should not root a personal device that you store your private information on. We recommend getting a cheap, dedicated test device instead. Many older devices, such as Google's Nexus series, can run the newest Android versions and are perfectly fine for testing.

                            <h3 class="content-title">Which Mobiles Can Be Rooted</h3>
                            <p>
                                Virtually any Android mobile can be rooted. Commercial versions of Android OS (which are Linux OS evolutions at the kernel level) are optimized for the mobile world. Some features have been removed or disabled for these versions, for example, non-privileged users' ability to become the 'root' user (who has elevated privileges). Rooting a phone means allowing users to become the root user, e.g., adding a standard Linux executable called su, which is used to change to another user account.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To root a mobile device, first, unlock its bootloader. The unlocking procedure depends on the device manufacturer. However, for practical reasons, rooting some mobile devices is more popular than rooting others, particularly when it comes to security testing: devices created by Google and manufactured by companies like Samsung, LG, and Motorola are among the most popular, particularly because they are used by many developers. The device warranty is not nullified when the bootloader is unlocked and Google provides many tools to support the root itself. A curated list of guides for rooting all major brand devices is posted on the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/root/" target="_blank">XDA forums</a>.

                            <h3 class="content-title">Rooting with Magisk</h3>
                            <p>
                                Magisk ("Magic Mask") is one way to root your Android device. Its specialty lies in the way the modifications on the system are performed. While other rooting tools alter the actual data on the system partition, Magisk does not (which is called "systemless"). This enables a way to hide the modifications from root-sensitive applications (e.g. for banking or games) and allows using the official Android OTA upgrades without the need to unroot the device beforehand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can get familiar with Magisk by reading the official <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/" target="_blank">documentation on GitHub</a>. If you don't have Magisk installed, you can find installation instructions in <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/">the documentation</a>. If you use an official Android version and plan to upgrade it, Magisk provides a <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/ota.html">tutorial on GitHub</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, developers can use the power of Magisk to create custom modules and <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/submission" target="_blank">submit</a> them to the official <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo">Magisk Modules repository</a>. Submitted modules can then be installed inside the Magisk Manager application. One of these installable modules is a systemless version of the famous <a href="https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer">Xposed Framework</a> (available for SDK versions up to 27).

                                A malicious app is a software or piece of code designed for nefarious purposes. As practice shows us, these purposes can range from recon (i.e., gathering intel on a designated target to track movement and identify vulnerabilities) to intentionally damage tangible or intangible assets

                                    <a href="https://artist.cispa.saarland/" target="_blank">ARTist</a> is a flexible open source instrumentation and hybrid analysis framework for Android apps and Android’s Java middleware. It is based on the Android Runtime’s (ART) compiler and modifies code during on-device compilation. ARTist blends particularly well into the Android app install mechanism because it does not change the app’s package (APK) file but just replaces the compiled native version, hence it preserves the package signature so that modified apps still receive updates.
